1.2 Scope and constraints
- Define in scope features
-- List MVP features by module (auth, billing, dashboard, admin).
--- Project listing pages with descriptions and key screenshots.

--- Interactive demos hosted on subdomains (e.g., CLI apps in emulated terminals).

--- Basic content management for adding/editing projects and demos.

--- Contact form for client inquiries.

--- Responsive design with Tailwind and ShadCN components.

--- Navigation/header/footer with clear site structure.

--- Blog/newsletter placeholders (without full functionality).

--- SEO metadata and social sharing support.

--- Optional: simple search/filter for projects.

-- Mark each feature as “must have”, “nice to have”, or “future”.

--- Project listings — must-have

--- Interactive demos — must-have

--- Content management — must-have

--- Contact form — must-have

--- Responsive design/layout — must-have

--- Navigation/header/footer — must-have

--- Blog/newsletter placeholders — nice-to-have

--- SEO metadata/social sharing — nice-to-have

--- Search/filter for projects — nice-to-have

--- Authentication — future

--- Billing/e-commerce/Stripe — future

--- Analytics dashboard — future

-- Identify any technical spikes or proof of concepts needed.

--- Refactoring the Next.js SaaS Starter template into a portfolio-focused site structure.

--- Implementing subdomain routing and isolation for interactive demos.

--- Building emulated terminal environments for hands-on project demos (e.g., xterm.js).

--- Ensuring responsive and accessible UI components using Tailwind/ShadCN.

--- Setting up basic content management workflow for adding and updating projects.

--- Optional future POC: integrating payments or subscriptions for e-commerce functionality.

- Define out of scope items

-- Explicitly list major features that will not be built in the first release.

--- User accounts and authentication

--- Billing or e-commerce (Stripe, subscriptions)

--- Full blog or newsletter system

--- Advanced analytics or site metrics

--- Advanced search or filtering for projects

--- Multi-user admin or collaboration features

--- Complex third-party integrations

--- Large-scale or fully sandboxed demo environments

-- Document assumptions (e.g., English only, desktop first UI).

--- The site’s main goal is to attract freelance and consulting clients.

--- MVP prioritizes speed and showcasing skills over complex features.

--- Visitors are expected to value interactive, hands-on demos.

--- The Next.js SaaS Starter template can be refactored into a portfolio.

--- Interactive demos will be hosted on subdomains without authentication.

--- E-commerce, authentication, blog/newsletter, and advanced analytics are future features.

--- Deployment is on a DigitalOcean VPS with adequate resources.

--- Design will be responsive and use Tailwind/ShadCN.

--- Key interactions: view projects, try demos, submit inquiries.

--- Basic security, performance, and accessibility standards are met for MVP.

- Capture technical constraints

-- Lock primary stack (Next.js SaaS starter, Postgres, Stripe).

--- Framework: Next.js (using SaaS Starter template as foundation)

--- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN component library

--- Hosting / Deployment: VPS on DigitalOcean

--- Interactive Demos: xterm.js (or similar) for terminal-style emulated environments

--- Build & Tooling: Node.js, Vercel/Next.js build tools, Git for version control

--- Future / Optional Integrations: PostgreSQL database with ORM, Stripe (billing), blog/newsletter CMS, analytics tools

-- Document hosting constraints (DigitalOcean now, Hetzner later).

--- The MVP site and all interactive demos will be hosted on a DigitalOcean VPS using existing credits.

--- The hosting setup must support subdomain routing for each demo.

--- Resource limits on the VPS (CPU, RAM, storage) may restrict the number or complexity of simultaneous interactive demos.

--- Future migration to Hetzner is planned, so the architecture should remain portable and easy to redeploy.

--- High availability, load balancing, or auto-scaling are not required for the MVP.
