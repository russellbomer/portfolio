# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Use ADRs to document significant technical decisions, their context, and consequences. Keep them short, link to anchors, and update when superseded.

## How to create an ADR

1. Copy `ADR-0000-template.md` to a new file with the next number, e.g. `ADR-0001-sample-title.md`.
2. Fill in context, decision, and consequences.
3. Reference personas/KPIs from `ai/anchors.json` when relevant.
4. Link to related PRs and issues.

## Naming

- `ADR-<number>-<kebab-title>.md`
- Increment `<number>` sequentially.

## Index

Maintain a simple list here of accepted ADRs with brief summaries.
