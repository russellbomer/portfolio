2.2 Functional requirements
- Capture feature level requirements

-- Short description.

--- Project Listings
---- Project Card Component — Display each project with title, description excerpt, key screenshot/image, and link to full project page. Built with ShadCN components and Tailwind styling for consistent design.
---- Project Detail Page — Full project page including extended description, multiple screenshots, tech stack used, key outcomes/metrics, and call-to-action linking to demo or contact form. Server-rendered via Next.js for SEO.
---- Project Filtering/Navigation — Simple category or tag-based navigation to browse projects (e.g., "Web Apps," "CLI Tools," "Backend"). Initially implemented as static filters in the UI; no full-text search required for MVP.

--- Interactive Demos
---- Subdomain Routing for Demos — Configure DigitalOcean VPS to route demo subdomains (e.g., quarry.portfolio.com) to corresponding demo environments. Each demo runs isolated on its own port.
---- Emulated Terminal Demo Environment — Implement xterm.js-based terminal emulator for CLI applications (e.g., Quarry web scraping tool). Pre-loaded with sample commands and output to showcase functionality without live backend processing.
---- Demo Session Management — Basic session handling for each demo (e.g., terminal state persists during a user's session but resets on reload or timeout). No authentication required; demos are publicly accessible.

--- Contact & Lead Generation
---- Contact Form — Simple form with fields: name, email, message, and project/service interest dropdown. Client-side validation for required fields and email format; form submission sends inquiry email to your inbox via nodemailer or similar.
---- Contact Form Success Feedback — Display success message after form submission; optionally include next steps or expected response time.

--- Navigation & Layout
---- Header/Navigation Bar — Fixed or sticky header with site logo/name, navigation links (Home, Projects, About, Contact), and responsive mobile menu. Built with ShadCN components.
---- Footer — Basic footer with copyright, social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.), and optional contact CTA. Responsive and consistent across all pages.
---- Home/Landing Page — Hero section introducing yourself and portfolio purpose, featured projects section, and CTA to explore demos or contact. Emphasizes interactive demos as differentiator.
---- Responsive Design — All pages adapt seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Tailwind utilities and ShadCN responsive components.

--- Content Management
---- Project Content Storage — Projects defined as markdown files or JSON objects in the repository (e.g., /content/projects/). Each project includes title, description, screenshots, tech stack, demo link, and metadata.
---- Static Site Generation — Next.js static generation (SSG) or incremental static regeneration (ISR) for project pages to ensure fast load times and SEO optimization.

--- SEO & Social Sharing
---- SEO Metadata — Meta tags (title, description, keywords) and Open Graph tags for each project page and the homepage. Configured via Next.js head or a metadata utility for consistency.
---- Social Sharing Support — Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags to enable proper link previews when portfolio or project pages are shared on social media.
---- Sitemap & Robots.txt — Auto-generated sitemap.xml and robots.txt for search engine indexing; configured in Next.js public folder.

--- Design & UX
---- Consistent Design System — Use Tailwind CSS for spacing, typography, and colors; leverage ShadCN prebuilt components (buttons, cards, forms) for UI consistency and rapid development.
---- Visual Polish & Accessibility — Ensure adequate color contrast, readable typography, and keyboard navigation for basic accessibility. No WCAG AA audit required for MVP, but common best practices applied.
